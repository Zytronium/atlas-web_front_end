<h1>Advanced HTML</h1>
<hr>
<p>This project is all about HTML.</p>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language used to create the
visual elements of a webpages, among other things. It can also be
used in substitute of Markdown syntax in a readme file, like this
one. (or at least, my IDE can render it that way)</p>
