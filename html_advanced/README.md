<h1>Advanced HTML</h1>
<hr>
<p>This project is all about HTML.</p>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language used to create webpages,
among other things. It can also be used in substitute
of markdown syntax in a readme file, like this one.
(or at least, my IDE can render it that way. Or maybe
its just similar, but not actually HTML syntax) </p>
