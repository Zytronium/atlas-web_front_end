# Atlas Web Development - Front End

---
Front end web development is the development of a website's visual elements.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a language mostly used in the creation
of websites; specifically, the visual elements of the website, such as text,
tables, images, and video/audio players. While you can do styling (I.E.
text color, background color, padding, margins, etc.) with HTML, it is
typically done with CSS (cascading style sheet). HTML and CSS make up the
front end of Websites, or the visual part. The back end would be the
functionality, like scripts written in Javascript.
