# Advanced CSS

---
This project is all about CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) works alongside a page's HTML elements, providing
styling for the elements. While you can add styling in HTML, it is easier and more
organized to do it through the stylesheet in CSS. CSS can set default style
attributes for an element, a specific part of an element, any element with a specific
ID, etc. In HTML, you have to specify it for every element individually, which might
be fine if you just want one specific element to be different from the rest, but
it is still generally seen as a better idea to do that in the stylesheet instead.

Some examples of CSS styling are font size, text color, overflow behavior, margins,
padding, rotation, background image, etc. When I was doing online school during my
last couple years of high school, I liked to mess with the school website using inspect
page while I was waiting for something, and I especially liked doing stuff like adding
a background image or background gradient. Sometimes I would go crazy and add a
circular spiral gradient background with a tiling animated rickroll GIF behind it, or
add a gradient to my course progress bar and change it to well over 100%, so it would
go off the screen. Honestly, inspect page is really fun if you know what you're doing,
and almost everything I learned about HTML and CSS before recently, I learned from using
inspect page.

CSS can transform a webpage from a [boring, bare-bones, 2000's style lump of text](https://github.com/Zytronium/atlas-web_front_end/blob/master/html_advanced/index.html) into a [modern,
beautiful, colorful, animated masterpiece](https://www.atlasschool.com), though I'm sure it's not that easy to create
a masterpiece like that.
